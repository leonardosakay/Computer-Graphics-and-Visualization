# Computer Graphics and Visualization - 3D scene project

While designing the application I took the bottom-up design approach, working on the most specific and basic components such as granually adding logic to the code to make the 3D scene more realistic until the results were satisfied. During this project I was able to improve my critical thinking and code analysis, one of the methodogies I utilized to improve the code was to constantly change sections of the code to understand the impact of the changes, additionally, I was able to design complex 3D shapes using primative shapes with OpenGL. The methodology of breaking the codes in section to understand it better can be utilized in any of the projects I will be working on. 
While working on the 3D scene I had to break down real objects from a 2D image into primitive shapes, the process of development was complicated at the beguining and it took me many tries until I was able to apply texture, and lighting correctly. To better understand how the code worked I had to break down a
